Please visit https://devchallenge-interior-design.web.app to checkout my demo. I built this with React. A few things I reviewed during the practice:

1. Add footer: set ```display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: space-between;``` to highest level component. 
2. Navigation component
  There are two ways to set navigation component responsive and display different component based on screen size: use matchmedia and use window.innerWidth. I used innerWidth in this practice.
3. Move element to top 50%: set ```translate: 0 -50%;``` to the element.
