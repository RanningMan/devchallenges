<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Used React to build this app. In order to reduce the network call, I used localStorage to save the response after the request was made for the first time.


### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Bu3G2irnaXmfwQ8sZkw8) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- [x] User story: I can see at least 2 types of questions: a city is the capital of.. or a flag belong to country..
- [x] User story: I can see select an answer
- [x] User story: I can see if my answer is correct or incorrect
- [x] User story: When I answer correctly, I can move on to the next question
- [x] User story: When I answer incorrectly, I can see my results and try again
- [x] User story: I can try again
